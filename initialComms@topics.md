### V2

Hi X, I am organising an event on AI for managers that I hope you might be interested in. The goal of this 1/2 day interactive event in mid August is to enable managers like yourself to discover how modern AI language pipelines are transforming business processes.

I want to tailor this event to your needs. So my questions to you are what topics and format would encourage you to spend a morning at this event? Would you be prepared to drop me a reply here on LinkedIn or give me a quick call before July 2nd (0439512475) to discuss.

This August event will be focussed on machine processing of unstructured texts (querying for information, automating assigning codes etc). Our experience with unstructured texts includes technical reports, manuals, safety records, maintenance work orders but this is the tip of the iceberg on what is possible. Managers know what their teams do, but need to know what is possible.

Did you know that the NLP-TLP group here at UWA is one of the world leaders in processing unstructured technical texts but we have more direct contact with companies in Europe and the US than we do in Perth! We are hoping this event will change this situation.

Hi X

I am organising an event on AI for managers that I hope you might be interested in. The goal of this 1/2 day interactive event in mid August is to enable managers like yourself to discover how modern AI pipelines are transforming business processes. I want to tailor this event to your needs and would appreciate some input from you on questions you'd like answered and topics discussed.

This August event will be focussed on processing of unstructured texts. Looking at how to 1) find and extract information at scale from historical texts 2) automate daily work done manually by team members involving manually assigning (or checking) codes to unstructured texts such as done to safety and maintenance records and 3) automate text-based analytics pipelines.

### Spare notes:

In talking to managers here in Perth we hear concerns about a) their own lack of familiarity with this emerging technology beyond a superficial understanding of its use in areas outside of their business, 2) how to move pipelines from the proof-of-concept to the deliver value stage. We also know that they are looking to talk to other managers about lessons learned and where they have found opportunities.

For years we have been very dependent of 3rd party software managed by IT to control our work flow processes. This is changing very fast as team members, especially engineers, realise they can use off-the-shelf programs, large language models and generative AI to automate things they have to do. There are huge opportunities with this but also risks to be managed.
