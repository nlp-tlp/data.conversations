### data.conversations@UWA

Data.conversations is a new series by the UWA Data Institute aimed at pulling back the curtain on AI for people at manager level and above that are not data science and IT practitioners.

The target attendee is someone who sees many potential opportunities for the introduction of AI to improve business process in their teams. This person wants to understand more about potential pipelines, capabilities, data, and time required, and hear what others' experiences have been. They'd value the opportunity to ask questions.

A data.conversations 1/2 day workshop is about having these conversations.

The format will be based on a series of short talks, panels and small group discussions with participants able to interact with the speakers and each other.

Each data.conversations workshop will have a theme.

The first data.conversations workshop will be on using *'Language-based pipelines to deliver value'*. Some have estimated that as much of 80% of corporate data is stored as unstructured text. How do you get value from this?

The event will be hosted by Professor Melinda Hodkiewicz and the team from the UWA NLP-TLP group https://nlp-tlp.org/ and include NLP-TLP members and industry speakers.


The NLP-TLP team is at the forefront internationally of technical language processing. They have practical experience in NLP, building annotated data sets for fine-tuning language models, knowledge graphs, ChatGPT, constructing ontologies on organisational data for addressing business questions.
