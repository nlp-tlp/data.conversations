Following on from my post last week, I will now look back at my video on graphs. The previous post emphasized the need for enterprises to rethink their data strategies, highlighting the crucial role of the Enterprise Knowledge Graph. Graphs gain new importance now that we have LLMs on the scene, so I think it is useful to revisit the questions: "What is a graph?" and "What makes graphs so useful?".

🔵 What is a Graph?
Graphs excel at capturing the inherent messiness of data while providing enough structure for efficient querying and reasoning. Let's break down what a graph is. Put simply, a graph is made up of nodes that are connected by edges.

🔹 Nodes (or Vertices): Represent data items (often depicted as circles in diagramming tools).
🔹 Edges: The connections between nodes (shown as lines that connect the circles).

In semantic graphs, we capture this structure using simple three-part statements:

🔹 Ben - a - Person
🔹 Bob - a - Person
🔹 Ben - son_of - Bob
🔹 Bob - lives_in - UK

You can reason over this graph structure. Test it yourself—given the structure above, answer the question: “Where does Bob's son live?” And (psst!) if you can reason over that, so can an LLM.

🔵 Why Graphs are Powerful
Graphs can model both tree-like and tabular data effortlessly, even accommodating complex concepts and rich data structures like images and text. This flexibility makes graphs a universal method of representing and interlinking various data forms. In other words, they are the perfect structure for solving the data integration problem. Listen up! Solving your organization's data integration problem should be the first step in your GenAI strategy.

🔵 The Importance of Relationships
One of the most significant advantages of graphs is the emphasis on relationships. The relationships (edges) between the data points (nodes) are as crucial as the data points themselves. This reflects a deep truth about reality: facts exist in a context, and understanding these connections to the context transforms isolated data points into meaningful information. Data is all about relationships and, again (psst!), the attention mechanism in an LLM's transformer model has been specifically designed to learn the relationships between tokens (which we can think of as a kind of data point).

🔵 Graphs in the Era of LLMs
Fast forward to today, with the rise of LLMs, the importance of Knowledge Graphs has only amplified. LLMs thrive on well-structured data with rich expressive relationships. Knowledge Graphs provide precisely that.

I hope you found this “back to basics” post useful. Let me know if you are getting bored of me doing these rewind-to-2020 posts and I will stop.
